 * To fix, remove the connector and swap the pins by using a paperclip or needle to push down the silver clip in the connector which will allow you to separate the pin from the connector.
 * When removed, the wires should appear as in the second picture.
 * Once swapped, place the red independent wire into the top pin in the same way it was connected in the bottom pin when you removed it.
