# Cutting Tools for BoXZY

We recommend the following characteristics when sourcing endmills:
 * Carbide
 * 2-flute (4-flute have very limited uses and it’s unlikely you would need them)
 * Square-nose OR ball-nose
 * 1/4" shaft size to fit into mill’s collet

Endmills can be found on: http://www.htcmfg.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=16

The following end mills are what we recommend you use to get started with BoXZY:

## Using Custom-Sized Collets and Collet Reducers

There are a few ways to use bit diameters that aren’t 1/4 “ shaft size. You can use ‘’’custom sized collets’’’ that are available for purchase [here](http://www.elairecorp.com/makitaroutercollets.html). You can also use a ‘’’collet reducer’’’ (also known as a collet adapter). A collet reducer adapts smaller bits to BoXZY's 1/4" shank. These insert into BoXZY's Milling Head. You can get them for many size bits.

You do not strictly need a collet reducer. You can do a great deal with a 1/4" bit, but you may wish to use smaller bits as you start different milling projects. You can purchase these [here](https://www.toolstoday.com/high-precision-steel-router-collet-reducers.html?variantids=5550,0).
