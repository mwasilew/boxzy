# 0.1 BoXZY Safe Use

**The safe use of BoXZY is your responsibility. CNC machines have inherent danger that only you, the user, can control. There are nearly infinite options for methods of safe use. We supply suggestions, but its up to you to use BoXZY safely.**

Before you begin the BoXZY Instructions, please read very carefully through this manual so that you are aware of some hazards associated with using BoXZY and some precautions you can take to avoid them. BoXZY is an extremely powerful tool, but it can be very dangerous if not operated and handled safely. It is your responsibility to ensure that BoXZY is used in a safe way, as intended. This includes following all instructions, except those that may put you in danger, and heeding all warnings described in these manuals. It also means familiarizing yourself with best practices for CNC machining and machine safety, using reliable sources.

Always be aware of your work environment when using BoXZY. Make sure that it is inaccessible to children, pets, and unaware adults. Safety is a social responsibility. When you bring BoXZY into your home, office, or school always consider those around you and those that could interact with the device, with or without your knowledge.

Revisit this manual frequently to refresh yourself, especially before beginning to use a new Attachment Head.

It’s always better to err on the side of caution, so if you’re unsure of something, ask before you do. You can ask questions in the answers forum or by contacting BoXZY at info@boxzy.com.

## Step 1 — Use Caution When Lifting BoXZY

 * LIFT CAREFULLY. If it’s dangerous for you to lift 55-65 lb, then do not attempt to lift BoXZY. Use proper form and best practices when lifting BoXZY to avoid strain or injury. If you cannot safely move or lift BoXZY, then get help from someone who can.
 * FALL AND CRUSH WARNING. Always place BoXZY on a stable, strong, level surface that can handle BoXZY's dynamic load. BoXZY's static load is between 55-65 pounds without user additions.

## Step 2 — Keep Hands Away from Machine When Running

 * NEVER PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE MACHINE WHILE IT’S RUNNING. Always use the Power Station’s physical e-stop button before placing your hands inside BoXZY. Always check that the green light on the Power Station is off before putting your hands in the machine.
 * Remember that the physical e-stop only interrupts commands. If you have to use the physical e-stop while commands are still being sent to BoXZY, make sure that you avoid any undesired behavior by also hitting the software e-stop. This will prevent the file from running where it left off when you release the physical e-stop.

## Step 3 — Never Leave the Machine Unattended 

 * NEVER LEAVE THE MACHINE UNATTENDED BY A RESPONSIBLE ADULT. When BoXZY is not in use, make sure that it’s properly disconnected from power and stored away from the hands of children.
 * KEEP PETS AWAY FROM THE MACHINE. Keep your pets away from BoXZY when it’s in use to avoid the risk of them crawling inside the machine when it’s on or exposure to BoXZY’s laser. Make sure that cables, tools, and any parts that can be chewed are stored away from your pets.

## Step 4 — Protect Your Eyes 

 * Always make sure that you and anyone around you are wearing eye protection when milling and laser engraving on BoXZY.
 * DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LASER ETCH REFLECTIVE SURFACES: Eye safety is especially important when using BoXZY’s Laser Head. Laser beams can reflect off of shiny surfaces into your eyes, the eyes of people and/or animals around, as well as onto skin, resulting in loss of vision or other physical harm that could be permanemt.
 * BoXZY's laser is made to quickly lose focus and dissipate over a short distance for safety, unlike a laser pointer. However, this can be undone. Always treat the laser as if it could cause damage at any distance.
 * Safety is social. When using the laser, always wear Laser Safety Glasses (as shown in the image) that protect from the wavelength of BoXZY’s laser (445nm). Make sure that any people inside the room are also wearing Laser Safety Glasses when the laser is in use. **The safety of those around you is your responsibility.**

## Step 5 — Fire Danger 

 * KEEP FLAMMABLE OBJECTS AWAY FROM BOXZY. BoXZY’s laser process produces high heat. Never walk away from your machine while the laser is powered on.
 * LET MATERIALS COOL BEFORE TOUCHING THEM. Do not touch anything worked on in BoXZY unless you are sure it is properly cooled. When you finish working on a material, visually verify that it is not at risk of catching on fire before hitting the physical e-stop and attempting to remove it from the platform. 

## Step 6 — Protect Your Lungs and Ventilate Your Work Area 

 * RESEARCH YOUR MATERIALS. When fabricating, there is always a risk of working with a toxic material. Make sure your work materials are non-toxic and that you wear a dust mask or respirator when necessary.
 * No odor does not mean its safe, and a strong odor won't mean its hazardous. Laser etching produces odors even on non-hazardous materials
 * VENTILATE WHEN NECESSARY. Make sure you have great ventilation and strong air circulation when you use BoXZY. Use fan ventilation when necessary and never attempt to etch onto a material that releases hazardous fumes.

## Step 8 — Beware of BoXZY's Moving Parts 

 * Never put your hands inside BoXZY unless the physical e-stop has been hit and the green light on the Power Station is off.
 * Secure all things that drape, dangle or protrude from your person. Remove lanyards, necklaces, scarves, shawls, and long sleeves. If you have long hair, tie it back out of the way.
 * Always make sure your jigs and fixtures are properly secured.
 * Always make sure you components are properly secured.
 * Service BoXZY regularly and make sure all fasteners and belts are tightened. Make sure the machine is well oiled.
 * Always make sure your bits are properly tightened and secured.
 * Do not use BoXZY or the Attachment Heads if you can hear loose bolts or components moving around, or if they are otherwise not functioning properly. Use them only after they have been repaired.

## Step 9 — A Clean Work Area Is a Safe Work Area 

 * KEEP A CLEAN, ORGANIZED, WELL-MAINTAINED WORK ENVIRONMENT. Clutter makes working with machinery dangerous and presents opportunities to impair a machine's function and cause it to interact with the environment in unpredictable ways.
 * KEEP BOXZY FREE OF DEBRIS. Be aware of debris in your space as it can dangerously interact with and damage electronic components and potentially create fires.
